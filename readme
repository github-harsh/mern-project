In package.json the scripts{} section has 2 commands viz. start and server
start : "node server" is for when we deploy our application on heroku
server : "nodemon server" is for when we run our application in the local environment
'server' in 'nodemon server' stands for 'server.js'

config dependency allows to define default values that can be used throughout the application.

Solution : Add userCreatIndex: true

Await should be added before any function which returns a promise

To run a command in a particular folder, we write the following command in the package.json:
"client: "npm start --prefix folder_name"

React dependencies command:
npm i axios react-router-dom redux  react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension moment react-moment

Whenever a request is made with axios e.g axios.get() we need to specify the entire URL e.g.
axios.get('http://localhost...')
To avoid this we can setup a proxy in the package.json of react application to specify the 'http://localhost:3000' part
